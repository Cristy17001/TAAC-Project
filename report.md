# TAAC Project Report

## 1. Identify Use Case

Define the scope of your project, the goals, and the specific task(s) you plan to address with your generative AI application. Define the inputs and outputs, the characteristics of the data, the requirements, and the possible major challenges.

The aim of this project was to use different artificial intelligence techiniques to based on a dataset of book text reviews predict the ratings associated review that was given to the book as well as determining the book gender

## 2. Experiment and Select

Decide if there exists a foundational model that is suitable for your application needs. If so, start with the simplest model and test various possible models that your hardware can handle.

## 3. Adapt, Align, and Augment

Generative models often need to be adapted and augmented with specific knowledge to solve your specific problem. Select and test the most appropriate techniques for data augmentation and model alignment.

## 4. Evaluate

Establish well-defined evaluation metrics and benchmarks to understand the progress resulting from your optimizations. Use traditional machine learning evaluation best practices, such as division into train/test/validation datasets and cross-validation.

## 5. Deploy and Integrate

Once you have well-tuned and aligned your generative model, deploy and create a prototype solution for inference. Aim to create a minimal user-friendly interface or easy-to-use application.
